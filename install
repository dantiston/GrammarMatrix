# install [OPTIONS] DEST

# install:  A script to create the working version of the Matrix
#           customization system.
# DEST:     The destination directory of the install
# OPTIONS:
#      -r: install remotely on homer.u.washington.edu
#    -lkb: prepare the LKB files for TbG (only needs to be done once;
#          if you want to refresh the files, delete the delphin directory)
#    -iso: get the iso table file from iso that allows iso validation
#
# Examples:
#      To install to a local directory:
#           ./install path/to/dest/
#      To install to a remote directory:
#           ./install user@host:/path/to/dest/
#      To install remotely on homer:
#           ./install -r my_branch
#       * Note that this is merely short for:
#           ./install uwcl@homer.u.washington.edu:~/public_html/my_branch
#      To install to www.delph-in.net/matrix:
#           ./install -r matrix/customize
#      To prepare the LKB files in an install to delph-in.net/matrix
#           ./install -r -lkb matrix/customize
