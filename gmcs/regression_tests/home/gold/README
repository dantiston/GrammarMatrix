This directory is used for storing gold-standard profiles created by
[incr tsdb()] in the process of regression tests.  Nothing should be
copied into this directory by hand.  Rather, it is populated by
add-regression-test() (lisp) and update-gold-standard.  After invoking
these commands, you will need to "cvs add" the resulting profiles or
"cvs commit" (in the case of update-gold-standard).
