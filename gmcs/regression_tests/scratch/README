This directory is meant as a sandbox for use in the process of
creating regression-tests.  It is a good place to store your choices
and txt-suite files that you pass to create-regression-test() (invoked
in the lisp buffer with the lkb running).  Nothing in this directory
should be under cvs control, other than this README file.
