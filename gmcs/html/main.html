  <p>The <a href="http://www.delph-in.net/matrix">LinGO Grammar
  Matrix</a> is developed at the University of Washington in the context
  of the <a href="http://www.delph-in.net/">DELPH-IN Consortium</a>,
  by <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/ebender">Emily M. Bender</a>
  and colleagues.  This material is based up work supported by
  the National Science Foundation under Grant No. BCS-0644097.
  Additional support for Grammar Matrix development came from a gift
  to the Turing Center from the Utilika Foundation.  Any opinions,
  findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this
  material are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily
  reflect the views of the National Science Foundation.
  The Grammar Matrix customization system is hosted by the University
  of Washington.</p>

  <p>Filling out this form will produce a starter grammar for a natural
  language, consisting of a language-independent core and customized
  support for the phenomena you describe below.  Note that this grammar
  fragment will only treat matrix (main) clauses. Be advised that this
  system is highly experimental.  We are interested in your feedback.

  <p>NOTE: Throughout the questionnaire, questions or subpages that lack
  a required answer or contain an incorrect answer are marked with a red
  asterisk:

  <span class="error" title="This asterisk is an exception. It has a
  tooltip even though it does not mark an error.">*</span>.

  Questions or subpages that contain answers that might be problematic,
  but are not outright incorrect, are marked with a red question mark:

  <span class="error" title="This question mark is similarly
  exceptional. It has a tooltip even though it does not mark a
  warning.">?</span>.

  Hovering the mouse cursor over a red asterisk or question mark will
  show a tooltip describing the error. Clicking on a red asterisk or
  question mark that is on the main page will link to the error or warning
  on the appropriate subpage.</p>
