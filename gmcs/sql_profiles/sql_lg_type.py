    - omitFeatures - a list of features that are irrelevant when comparing two language types for
                            equalness
    - regexMatchWithLT - function that tries to find a regex match for a given feature pair from a
                                    filter in a language type
    - check_lt_for_fvs - function that compares the feat/val pairs of a feature group in with a dict of
                                feat/val pairs to see if those in the feat group  are the same as those in
                                the dict.  used to try to find an existing language type in the database
                                given a set of feat/val pairs
    - check_lt_for_grp_ids - function that checks to see if the grp_ids that define a language type
                                       in Matrix TDB have feature/value combos that match the language
                                       type defined by a dict of feat/val pairs representing a chocies file
    - check_existing_lt_for_completeness - function that checks that all the feature/value combos
                                                              in a choices file match those of a language type
    - lt_exists - function that finds the id of a language type in MatrixTDB that matches the
                     language type defined by a choices if one exists.
    - singleton_group_exists - function that determines whether or not f/v exist as a singleton
                                          feat/val group in MatrixTDB.
    - update_feat_group - function that inserts every feat/val combo in a choices file into the
                                   database as a singleton group if such a group doesn't already exist
    - update_lt_in_lfg - function that ensures that a language type is linked to the right feature
                               groups
    - create_or_update_lt - function that, if a language type that matches a choices file exists, it
                                     returns its ID.  If not, it creates one (with input from user) and returns
                                     that ID.
    - main - function that reads in a choices file.  If that file is already in MatrixTDB as a language
                type, returns the ID of that language type.  If not, it adds it as a language type and
                returns that new ID
    - main code that gets the name of a choices file from the command line or the user and uses
      it to call main

# ERB 2007-06-06 Updating this so that we put in singleton
# feature groups for all f:v pairs in the lt definition that aren't
# already in the DB.  These won't (initially anyway) have
# filters that care about them, but I don't see that that will hurt
# anything.

# When we take a lt and look for its filters, we get all the
# feature groups that correspond to the language type, and then
# get all of the filters that correspond to those feature groups.

# Then I can define a function 'update_lt_in_lfg' that
# looks at the lt definition in terms of fv pairs and finds all
# new groups that should be added for it.
