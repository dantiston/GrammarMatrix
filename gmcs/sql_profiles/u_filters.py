    - filter_list - the list of the 17 universal filters

History:
    9/4/09 - KEN added filter uf17 to accomodate nf being an affix and not part of a word.  It is a
                 corollary to uf12 and uf15
    9/8/09 - re-ordered filters so ones that should eliminate most are nearer top.  E.g., anything
                 that filters out weird affixes like nf on a non-verb should be near the top because that
                 will filter out so many.
