  <h3>Customized Matrix</h3>

  <p>A customized copy of the Matrix has been created for you.
  Please download it <a href="sessions/7777/test_grammar.zip">here</a>.

  <p>This file will be removed from the system in 24 hours.

  <h3>Instructions</h3>

  <p>To unpack the archive, if your browser hasn't already done it for
  you, first try saving it on your desktop and double-clicking it.  If
  that doesn't work, and you're using Linux or Mac OS X, from a command
  prompt, type <tt>tar xzf matrix.tar.gz</tt> or <tt>unzip matrix.zip</tt>.

  <p>Once you've unpacked the archive you should find a directory called
  <tt>matrix</tt>.  Inside the directory are several files.  Here is
  an explanation of some:

  <ul>
  <li><tt>matrix.tdl</tt>: Language independent type and constraint
  definitions.  You should not need to modify this file.
  <li><tt>my_language.tdl</tt>: Types and constraints specific to your
  language.  (Actual file name depends on the name of your language.)
  <li><tt>lexicon.tdl</tt>: Lexical entries for your language.
  <li><tt>rules.tdl</tt>: Phrase structure rule instance entries for
  your language.
  <li><tt>irules.tdl</tt>: Spelling-changing lexical rule instance
  entries for your language.
  <li><tt>lrules.tdl</tt>: Non-spelling-changing lexical rule instance
  entries for your language.
  <li><tt>lkb/script</tt>: The script file for loading your grammar into
  the LKB.
  <li><tt>choices</tt>: A record of the information you
  provided in the matrix configuration form.
  </ul>

  <p>To run this grammar, start the LKB, and the load it by selected
  "Load > Complete grammar..." from the LKB menu.  You can then parse a
  sentence by selecting "Parse > Parse input..." from the LKB menu.  The
  dialog box that pops up should include the sentences you filled into
  the form.  When a sentence parses successfully, you can try generating
  from the resulting semantic representation by selecting "Generate" or
  "Generate from edge" from the pop-up menu.  For more on using the LKB,
  see the <a href="http://www.delph-in.net/lkb">LKB page</a> and/or
