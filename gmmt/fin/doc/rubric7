But the adverb's MOD value is a verb, which has an event
as the value of its HOOK.INDEX, so the feature PNG should
be inappropriate.  I suspect it's only working because your
lexical rules are losing the INDEX value of the verb along
the way.

We talked in person about an alternative solution, where
the negative element is actually treated as a verbal prefix.
Despite what the orthography would have you believe, I suspect
this is a better approach.  It might be interesting to look
into the linguistic literature on negation in Finnish and
see what folks have said (try searching the MLA bibliography
for Finnish and negation).

Was it really just this that changed?  The processing problem
you describe sounds more like something was spinning.  Hmmm...
it's possible that this kind of "affix stripping" rule was
able to spin with your affix adding rules in the morphology component.
At any rate, the problem with only accepting minA didn't have to
do with phonology --- it was that you're using the 1sg lex rule
as a daughter, and that's filling in PNG info on the subject.
