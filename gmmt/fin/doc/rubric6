Lab 6 Grading Rubric


A property of the imperatives evident in your examples that
you don't note is that the subject is dropped.

No description of the syntax of embedded interrogatives.

You don't really describe how you handled the syntactic properties
of interrogatives in any detail.  No description of how you
handled semantic properties.

The reason your imperative transitives and ditransitives
didn't work is this:

 imperative-head-opt-subj-phrase := basic-head-opt-subj-phrase &
 [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.IMPERATIVE +,
   HEAD-DTR imp_verb-lex-rule & [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.IMPERATIVE + ]].

The head-dtr is required to be a particular lexical rule, and
not any [ IMPERATIVE + ] VP.

>The only other obvious difference in

The relation labeled 'predsort' is a quantifier, suggesting
that your bare-np-phrase isn't filling in (anymore?) an appropriate
PRED value for the quantifier it introduces.

Indeed, "I know what you eat" is an example of an embedded
wh-question (content question), not an embedded yes-no question,
and should be treated in terms of a long-distance dependencies.
I'll be you find that your analysis doesn't work with obligatorily
transitive verbs (i.e., verbs with [OPT -] complements) or with
intransitives.
