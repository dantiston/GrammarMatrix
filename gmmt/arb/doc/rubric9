 -- Replaced Matrix, removed comps <> constraint from HEAD-DTR on
 basic-head-subj phrase

 -- Added 

Added what?

 HOW IT'S HANDLED:

 I changed the head-subj-phrase to inherit from head-final rather than
 head-initial. This made SVO word order the default, and kept the constraints
 for verb-noun agreement I had made on my subj-agreement-lex-rule types. 

 For VSO word order to be handled, I made a new set of lexical rules that
 inherit from defl-subj-agreement-lex-rule, a infl-val-change-only rule that
 moves constrains the verb's SUBJ to be null and identifies the elements of the
 ARG-ST with the COMPS.

 The subtypes of this rule all inflect with the singular form, but only constrain
 the GEND and PER of the first COMPS element.

Nice.

 (since this is a ltol-rule, I also added a const-ltow-rule that takes only this
 type of rule as input)

Ah, this is because the ltow type disallows changes to ARG-ST, right?

 number := *top*.
 sg := number.
 du := number.   
 pl := number.

This was supposed to have non-sg as a supertype of du and pl, for
compatibility with other languages.
