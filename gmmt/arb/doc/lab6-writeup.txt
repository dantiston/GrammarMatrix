-----========= Discourse Status: ==========---------

Pt. I: DEFINITES
---------------

Getting at discourse status is difficult from what I've learned
about Arabic so far, but I'll try to understand it by writing it
down as I go.

To begin with, something that seems to "anchor" what I've read
so far seems to be that the Demonstratives, which logically should
be active-or-more, when used adjectivally, must have the head
NP grammatically definite (this means one of three things;
either marked with the definite prefix /?al-/, marked with
a pronomial clitic (suffix) used for possessives, or if the following
noun is in the genitive (for "construct" phrases).

This would seem to indicate to me that definiteness must be at least
partially correlated to whatever status is aligned with demonstratives,
which I will get to later, but seem to be activ-or-more.

Some more info that helps place the definite marker -- As noted by
the holes text, UniqueID cases are marked in this way.

e.g. ?al-qamar (the moon), ?al-wila:ya:tu l-muttah.ida (the United States)
(p. 196)

There are other examples where the focus seems to be closer to
active-or-more:

?al-yawm = Today (lit. "the day")
?as-sa:'a = at the time (lit. "the hour")
(p. 196)

Lastly, generic refernce (though we're calling it outside the scope
of the class) seems to pick out the familiar status, with:

qami:s. mina l-qut.n
shirt   of   the-cotton
'A cotton shirt'

Lastly, when used with any time of verbal nouns or nominal adjectives
the familiar case seems to again be used:

?al-tadxi:n    xat.ar   'ala:  s.-s.ih.h.a
the-smoking    danger   to     the-health
'Smoking is dangerous to the health' (p. 198)

Taking all of these cases into account, it
would seem to me that the /?al-/ prefix denotes a
uniq-or-more status for the nouns it marks -- a pretty broad scope,
but one that accounts for all these various uses.

Thankfully, since I had implemented the lexical rules for
these markings in lab 5, for this lab I simply added the
COG-ST constraints onto the existing rules.

Pt. II: INDEFINITES
------------------------

From what little info I was able to surmise about definite marking,
there is little or no information given on the final /-n/, which I
have come to learn is often mistakenly thought of to be an indefinite
marking.

According to wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nunation),
Nunation is slightly different from an indefinite marker; it more
precisely marks that the noun is NOT marked for definiteness.

What seems to be confusing about this is that this final /-n/ is not
usually written in the orthography except for the feminine accusative,
and is only pronounced non-"pausally", which is a form of pronunciation
apparantly mostly associated with formal reading aloud.

Pausal rules require the nunation to be pronounced only prepausally,
(before any sentence-ending punctuation).

It appears that there are several exceptions, but in general, then
the /-n/ final form is the "default" marking for a noun, and is
removed when the definite is attached. Any time it is missing in
the examples I've found is probably due to the above restrictions
on pronounciation and lack of presence in the original orthography.

As a result, ultimately, also due to the large scope shown by the
?al prefix, it seems that the -n ending should be constrained to
the type-id case. I added this to my pre-existing lexical rule for
indefinites.



------========== DEMONSTRATIVES ========--------------

                     Proximal                  Distal

Sg.   Masc.          ha:Da:                    Da:(li)ka
      Fem.           ha:Di(hi)                 tilka

Pl.   Both           ha:?ula:?i                ?u:la:?ika

        M.   Nom.    ha:Da:ni                  Da:nika
Dual       Acc/Gen   ha:Dayni                  Daynika
        F.   Nom.    ha:ta:ni                  ta:nika
           Acc/Gen   ha:tayni                  taynika

...these forms are marked for gender, number, and case, though
the latter only shows up in the dual forms.

ha:- is the Proximal marker, while -(li)ka marks distals. Since
the forms are so close, I will be adding the "base" forms in, then
adding whether they are proximal or distal with a lexical rule. (Making
the singular feminine an exception.)

It appears that the demonstrative pronouns in Arabic have three
usages; as adjectives and presentatives (a form of emphasis,
specifically for present objects), and as subjects of "verbless"
copulas. This second case appears to be the only way they
are ever used as a pure pronoun.

bayt-i:       ha:Da:           ha:Da: bayt-i:
house-my      this      <VS>   this   house-my
'This house of mine'           'this is my house'

* As an interesting note, when the following noun has been made definite
  but 

Since I have not implemented the copula phrase yet, and since this is the
minority case, I will choose to implement the adjectival version discussed
below.

In all the adjectival cases, demonstratives occur with grammatically definite NPs. 
In the case of the simple definite, they precede the noun, while in 
cases of either posessive pronoun affixation or the genitive "construct"
phrases (see example below), they occur after.

ha:Da:  l-?akl                  ?akl-i:  ha:Da:
this    the-food       <VS>     food-my  this
'This food'                     'This food of mine'

I haven't yet gotten to this case, so for now I'm just dealing with the raw
adjective by giving it its own new form, demon_adjective (scary!) and
having it constrain the element on its COG-ST to be activ-or-more.

----------========== DITRANSITIVES ==========--------------

I had a terribly hard time trying to find a description of ditransitive
verbs in Arabic. My grammar has no chapters describing it, and searching
the web for "ditransitive" in arabic doesn't produce much. Furthermore,
it appears from what I have gleaned that ditransitives have their second
argument marked just by word order, and the term "indirect object" appears
to not be helpful either, since for all other respects, this second
argument appears just like the first object.

The form appears to be:
 <SUBJ-PREFFIX> <ROOT> <SUBJ-SUFFIX> <IND-OBJ> <DIR-OBJ>

Where the subject may either be prefixed or suffixed, and the
both objects may either be incorporated pronouns, or full NPs,
with the "indirect" object being the first.

** My primary source for examples of this comes from my "Source C"
   examples; but as they use the past tense, I've commented them out
   in order to keep tense standard.


-------============ ARGUMENT OPTIONALITY ======--------------

I searched for quite some time on this subject, and only encountered
papers covering that which I already learned; that Arabic has rather
systematic subject pro-drop and object incorporation as pronouns, but
I found nothing concerning the possibility for the type of Discourse
related object drop we're interested in.

As far as I can tell, subject prodrop is allowed with definite
instantiation, and object prodrop is not allowed; it must be made
up with pronoun incorporation (where the COG-ST is made explicit
by the pronoun).

ARGUMENT PATTERNS:
-------------------

I've found the following patterns, and tried to represent them all in
my modified test suite.

FOR ALL NOUNS:

1) No missing arguments, verb shows agreement with subject NP (case-marked)
2) Missing subject NP, verb shows agreement

EXAMPLES:

yatay       rrajulu       lwalada      lkita:ba
y-atay      ?al-rajul-u   ?al-walad-a  ?al-kita:b-a
3MSG-give   the-man-NOM   the-boy-ACC  the-book-ACC
'The man gives the boy the book'

VERSUS:

yatay       lwalada      lkita:ba
y-atay      ?al-walad-a  ?al-kita:b-a
3MSG-give   the-boy-ACC  the-book-ACC
'He gives the boy the book'

...this latter case seems to be constrained to dropping the subject for
activ-or-more. Furthermore, this seems to happen for all verbs, so I added
OPT-CS activ-or-more to the verb-lex's SUBJ constraints.

Since the verb ALWAYS shows agreement marking, the top two should be considered
variants of all the following:

-- Transitive:

3) Explicit object (generally only third person)
4) Incorporated objected pronoun

EXAMPLE OF 4:

y-adribu-hu       ?al-rajul-u
3MSG-hit-him      the-man-NOM
' The man hits him ' (would be 'he hits him' when missing explicit subj)

-- Ditransitive:

5) Explicit (indirect) object, explicit (direct) object
6) incorporated (indirect) object, explicit (direct) object
7) incorporated (indirect) object, incorporated (direct) object

?? 8) Explicit (indiret) object, incorporated (direct) object

Example of 5):
yatay       rrajulu       lwalada      lkita:ba
y-atay      ?al-rajul-u   ?al-walad-a  ?al-kita:b-a
3MSG-give   the-man-NOM   the-boy-ACC  the-book-ACC


Example of 6):
yatayhu        rrajulu       lkita:ba
y-atay-hu      ?al-rajul-u   ?al-kita:b-a
3MSG-give-him  the-man-NOM   the-book-ACC


Example of 7):
yatayhuhu         rrajulu
y-atay-hu-hu      ?al-rajul-u
3MSG-give-him-it  the-man-NOM
' The man gives him it'


... I haven't seen any examples about the grammaticality of an 
incorporated second argument (direct object) but an EXPLICIT first
argument (ind. obj) , but I have found in snippets that suggest the
dialects rely on word order for object understanding, so it seems
there may not be anything I can do to block this directly, since
it will look exactly like #6.

UPDATE: I talked to Margalit about Hebrew, and she says in the case
of double-object verbs in Hebrew, at least, there doesn't seem to
be a clear distinction about how to do it one way or another, and
it's largely dependent on semantics (i.e. giving a boy to a book?)


(see http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=ary)


TESTING:
----------------------

I added a bunch of instances of pronoun incorporation to my test suite,
and I think I have most if not all cases covered. I tested:

Broken:

I haven't investigated thoroughly, but it seems when I try incorporating
both the direct and indirect object


------------=========== MODIFICATION =============-----------------

ADJECTIVES:
-----------

As I didn't implement agreement in the last assignment, there was 
plenty of work for me to do here. First and foremost, was to get
rid of the "FNT" head feature I'd introduced in an earlier lab, now
that this distinction is subsumed by the COG-ST.

I'd already implemented adjectives as posthead modifiers in lab 5,
so the difficult part was simply getting agreement working.

As I've mentioned, adjectives (with the exception of demonstratives)
are post-head ( a fact that inspired me to create both posthead-adj
and prehead-adj types for each of these to inherit from ) and agree
with their nouns in case, number and definiteness. Since adjectives
are inflected to match their nouns, I made lexical rules that added
the appropriate affix for both nouns and adjectives; though for
adjectives I needed separate rules so that I could add the constraints
to the MOD feature of element the adjective selects for, since these
features don't exist in an equivalent place on the adjective itself.

TESTING:

I no longer get parses when the case or definiteness of the adjectives
do not match, and I believe most or all of the cases in which they do.

** Something I still haven't figured out, however, is when generating I
get extra parses which seem to take definiteness and case as optional
on adjectives, but not nouns.


ADVERBS:
----------

Since both verbs and noun are often strongly related in Arabic through
the consonantal clusters they all derive from, "verbal" nouns are quite
common, and as such, from what I've determined, most productive adverb
classes are actually adjectival in nature. Another interesting example is
where a verbal noun is taken as an object to a verb, and then modified
adjectivally.

p. 257 in the Clive Holes book:

darabahu      darban              s^adi:dan
darab-a-hu    darb-a-n            s^adi:d-a-n
hit-3msg-him  hitting-ACC-INDEF   strong-ACC-INDEF
'he hit him hard'

This is the absolutive accusative construction, and rather uncommon.

There is a relatively closed class of "pure" adverbs, however, that usually
signal time and a number of different types of manner. 

No matter what time of adverb, the sources I've read seem to indicate that
in the vast majority of cases the adverb simply attaches to the right
(...in Latin orthography... that could get confusing!) of the entire VP,
such as the example above, or:

y-ins.arifu   ?al-rajul-u      kawam
3MSG-leave    the-man-NOM      quick(ly)
'the man leaves quickly'


To make things simple until I can get into these verbal nouns more in-depth, 
I simply added this type "kawam" to my grammar and made it POSTHEAD +.

With the rather simple sentences that I'm still parsing, this seem to be
all that was needed to get kawam appearing in the right place.

WRAP-UP:
---------
I tried to fix a number of examples that were broken in my test suite.
By introducing agreement as well as a few more lexical entries, I was
able to seriously reduce overgeneration and increase coverage. 

On the examples I covered last time, I reduced the number of readings
by half generally, and increased coverage (over the newly added material
as well, admittedly) to now 26%.
