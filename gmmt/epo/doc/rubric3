The extra parses with determiners showing up as complements
are happening because your COMPS lists are unbounded.  The
first thing is correctly constrained to be an NP, but after
that, anything goes.  Since you're using the free-word
order module, there's a rule that allows the second complement
to be realized before the first...

English has both premodifiers (the black cat) and postmodifiers
(the cat on the mat), but with a few exceptions (attorney general),
single-word APs serving as noun modifiers show up before the
head.

-> _Accusative_ case is expressed...

If the inflected determiners can iterate, it sounds like they
might not be determiners.  Do they co-occur with the uninflected
one?

Does itsdb work better?  I had no problems running your test suite...
(Or maybe your itsdb testsuite is ascii?)
