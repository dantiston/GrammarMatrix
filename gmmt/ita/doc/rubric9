 Non mangi-o la pasta.  (I don't eat the staple+food)

 lexical top

LTOP stands for 'local top' (as in the topmost handle of
the local mrs).

 the argrument optionality marker

Probably  better to call these incorporated pronouns.

 In Italian the modal can also take all of the verb's arguments and add
 an argument optionality marker on itself.  Even though I have received
 significant help from the teacher on this, I did not have time to
 complete this.  It is semantic sugar, and there will be at least one
 parse for the machine translation extravaganza.  These sentences
 should also parse, but don't

That's too bad.  :-(

Listening to the talk on Clitic Cimbing in Spanish last Friday,
I realized we could make things a little simpler.  Potere either
takes a bare verb and 'raise' all of its arguments (argument composition)
or it takes a VP.  Then the argument-composition potere can undergo
some set of clitic rules, but doesn't have to.  You'd get structures
like this:

[potere mangiare] la pasta

... so maybe you should somehow require the argument composition
potere to undergo at least one clitic rule.  As long as it takes
all of the arguments over or just the subject, though, you'll get
the clitic clumping effect.

Your head-opt-subj rule needs to inherit from head-compositional.
Without that, the qeq for the prop-or-ques_m_rel gets broken.


You're right that the reflexive verbs need to be handled
separately.  I think the way to go is with the ones that are
*lexically* required to be reflexive, that affix is really just
an agreement marker with the subject.  

Still, that's not what's going on with mi-duole, and I'm surprised
that it generates duole, since duole shouldn't have 1sg on the ARG2.
