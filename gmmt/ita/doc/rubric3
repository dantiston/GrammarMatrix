Comments:

The reason that you get contrasts in judgments for what is (from
a linguist's perspective) the same order is that the non-basic
word orders can be pragmatically constrained.  Longer sentences/
sentence which have more context embedded in them are easier to 
judge in isolation.

There's a mismatch here:

  Source: author
  Vetted: t
  Judgment: u
  Phenomena: {wo}
  Aiuta gli studenti il professore 
  Aiut-a il professore gli studenti
  helps.3sg the.m.sg professor the.m.pl students
  `The professor helps the students'

Something's off about d-anno, too. I think maybe
the gloss line should have give-3pl, rather than
give.3pl.

  Vetted: t
  Judgment: u
  Phenomena: {wo}
  *I ragazzi danno ad un amico conforto
  i ragazzi d-anno ad un amico conforto
  the.m.pl youth give.3pl to a.m.sg friend comfort
  `The young people comfort a friend'

So you're finding strict SVO for transitives  (pronouns aside)
and SV or VS for intransitives?  What about when there are
adverbs?  Do you get:

S V adv
V adv S
V S adv


Is this one really 3s, and not 2s?

  Source: author
  Vetted: t
  Judgment: g
  Phenomena: {neg}
  Non canta
  non cant-a
  no sing-3sg
  'You donâ€™t sing'

Why is this one tagged as both emb-q and emb-d?

  Source: author
  Vetted: t
  Judgment: g
  Phenomena: {emb-q emb-d}
  Mi domando se è certo
  Mi domand-o se è cert-o
  me.acc.1sg ask-1sg if is.3sg right-sg.m
  'I wonder if itâ€™s right'
