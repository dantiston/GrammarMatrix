Your negation examples only illustrate a little of what you
describe in the write up.  You should add some examples of
negated transitive verbs with and without pronominal objects.
Likewise, there should be some examples involving both negation
and auxiliaries.

What happens with yes/no questions when there are auxiliaries?
... I see you mention this under modals.

It seems from your description that imperatives involve subject-verb
inversion as well, though you don't state so outright.  Is this
true?  What happens in transitive imperatives?

You'll eventually need to find data regarding embedded clauses,
since there will be a lab on that.
