In the MRS for a negated sentence, you want the LTOP
to come from the _neg_r_rel, but the INDEX to come from
the verb.  The way to do this is to make sure that
your neg-infl-lex-rule identifies its C-CONT.HOOK.INDEX  
with the DTR's HOOK.INDEX rather than with the ARG0 in
the _neg_r_rel. That bug was actually introduced by the
customization script, but you should fix it anyway :-)

Your semantics for nge- (can't) need some decomposition.
That is, rather than put in _can't_v_rel, you should put
in _not_r_rel (whose ARG1 is qeq the LBL of the _can_v_rel)
and _can_v_rel (whose ARG1 is qeq the LBL of the verb's
relation).  The INDEX of the whole thing should be the
ARG0 of the _can_v_rel.  To achieve this, your lexical
rule for nge- will add *two* things to each of the C-CONT.RELS
and C-CONT.HCONS.

Your semantics for this one:

 musa-ni uku-gijim-a
 don't-PL INF-run-FV
 'Don't run!'

is a little broken, too:  The ARG1 of the _neg_v_rel doesn't
qeq the LBL of the _run_v_rel (and the INDEX of the whole
thing should be the ARG0 of _run_v_rel, not _neg_v_rel).

 The other thing that I changed from the lab instructions was the PRED
 value, which I left underspecified in the basic ability-lex-rule.  I
 then created two subtypes: pos-ability-lex-rule and
 neg-ability-lex-rule, to account for the different prefixes discussed
 above.

You still want to do something like this, but you'll need to push
more stuff down to the subtypes, since they should have different
numbers of rels/qeqs.

I notice that your bare-np-phrase is still putting in unspec_q_rel,
rather than _exist_q_rel (per Lab 5 instructions).  

For next week, I suggest that you fix the things noted above,
and then try to get the FV working.  (You might want to consult
the Swahili grammar --- I sent it to you at the beginning of the
quarter, right? --- to see what Dan did.)  You should also make
sure that demonstratives are working, if you haven't done so already.

p.s. You still have some of those huge files sitting around in
your directory.  It's probably a good idea to delete them :-)
