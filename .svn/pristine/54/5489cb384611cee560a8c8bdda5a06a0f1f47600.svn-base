Lab 6 Grading Rubric

 
 By the way, are word order differences related to the length of a
 constituent, such as the order of heavy constructions in English
 considered a grammatical or discourse level issue?

Not really either.  They're grammar-y, but more probabilistic than
other grammar-y stuff.  So, related to performance, maybe, but not
discourse so much.

 Otherwise, the MRS looks pretty much as it should. Another potential
 issue aside from the definiteness issue is the fact that the order of
 the arguments within h5 and H12 is reversed compared to what is shown
 in the instructions.I don't know what that means.

This is not important --- what is important is that the second argument
of each quantifier is on the left of a qeq, and the third is not
related to any qeqs.
