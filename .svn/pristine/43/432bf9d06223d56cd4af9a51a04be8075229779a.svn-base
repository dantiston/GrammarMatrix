Project: MatrixTDB
Project Owner: Emily M. Bender
Contents: (listed, when possible, in order of execution)
    main code that creates appropriate connection to database and calls main()
    main - Asks the user if the want to replace the result of some filters or if they want to run
             filters on new results that they've imported.  The replace case is not working.  In the
             add case, it gets an osp_id then calls add_to_res_fltr to record the first fail of every
             result in that original source profile in res_fltr.
    find_filter_from_name - looks through filter_list for a Filter with name n and returns it
    update_res_fltr - Doesn't work.  See function doco below.
    make_string - Doesn't work.  See function doco below.
    add_to_res_fltr - Gathers all [incr_tsdb()] results from an original source profile (osp_id) and
                             runs each filter on each result, recording the "result" of the first fail on every
                             string in res_fltr.  Also informs the user how many items failed a filter and
                             how many passed all filters.
    insertManyUnivFails - function that inserts several universal filter rails into res_fltr at a time.
Tables Accessed: result, filter, fltr_mrs, res_fltr, parse, item_tsdb
Tables Modified: filter, fltr_mrs, res_fltr
Note: The case in main where a user wants to replace results for certain filters is untested an
         known not to work.  See comments in main and update_res_fltr for more details.
