Lab 9 Writeup:

* NOTE: I'm afraid I've been running into a bunch of translation problems trying
to get this to work, and it's fast approaching midnight. I've tried to note the
interesting things I was able to get to transfer, as well as hopefully some
info that should help debugging.

----====== GRAMMAR CLEAN-UP =====-----

--Replaced Matrix, removed comps <> constraint from HEAD-DTR on
basic-head-subj phrase

-- Added 

FIXING BARE AFFIXES:

-- I noticed for some reason I'd forgot to put %suffix instead of %prefix
for some of my circumfix affixes. (Copy and paste problem).

-- Changed the DTR type on all second-applying circumfix rules to not just
be the parent circumfix_rule type, but rather the type of only the previously
applying rule.

-- Refined the input/output constraints on the pronoun incorporation rules.
I had previously only constrained them to apply to a type uninfl_verb (slightly
different from INFLECTED +, as I wanted to distinguish between object incorporation
and verb/noun agreement). To reduce spurious chart edges, I instead made two subtypes
of uninfl_verb (so as to not break the ordering of other rules), can_incorp and
dont_incorp. I constrained the object incorporation rule to only take can_incorp, and
added dont_incorp as a supertype to some verb-lex items such as modal_verb_lex and
intransitive-verb-lex.

This didn't completely fix my problem with reaching too many chart edges, but it did
greatly reduce it.


---======= DEFLECTED AGREEMENT ======-------

To recap, deflected agreement behaves the following way in Arabic:

Inflection is changed only on the verbs.

In SVO word order, nouns and all verbs agree in both person/gender and number.

In VSO word order, agreement is for person/gender, but number agreement *on the verb* is always singular, regardless of the number on the noun. This appears to be the case for all verbs.

Examples:

(SVO - Full agreement)

?al-?awlad-u y-i?ra-u: ?al-dars-a
the-boys-NOM 3MPL-read-3MPL the-lesson-ACC
'the boys read the lesson'

VSO (Partial Agreement)
y-i?ra ?al-?awlad-u ?al-dars-a
3MSG-read the-boys-NOM the-lesson-ACC
'the boys read the lesson'

* SVO (Partial agreement)
?al-?awlad-u y-i?ra: ?al-dars-a
the-boys-NOM 3MSG-read the-lesson-ACC
'* the boys read the lesson'

* VSO (Full Agreement)
y-i?ra-u: ?al-?awlad-u ?al-dars-a
3MPL-read-3MPL the-boys-NOM the-lesson-ACC
'* the boys read the lesson'

--------
HOW IT'S HANDLED:

I changed the head-subj-phrase to inherit from head-final rather than
head-initial. This made SVO word order the default, and kept the constraints
for verb-noun agreement I had made on my subj-agreement-lex-rule types.

For VSO word order to be handled, I made a new set of lexical rules that
inherit from defl-subj-agreement-lex-rule, a infl-val-change-only rule that
moves constrains the verb's SUBJ to be null and identifies the elements of the
ARG-ST with the COMPS.

The subtypes of this rule all inflect with the singular form, but only constrain
the GEND and PER of the first COMPS element.

(since this is a ltol-rule, I also added a const-ltow-rule that takes only this
type of rule as input)


================== SOME INTERESTING EXAMPLES FOR MT =============

Embedded pronouns:-----------------

t-atay-ni: ?al-mara-u ?al-taam-a
"The woman gave me food"

Embedded Clause with pro-drop:-----------------

y-aftikir-na ?anna rajul-u-n t-ishtara ?al-taam-a
"They (fem) think that the a man buys the food"

Deflected agreement:---------------

 ?al-?awlad-u  y-i?ra-u:      ?al-dars-a (SVO + FULL)
 y-i?ra        ?al-?awlad-u   ?al-dars-a (VSO + PARTIAL)


* y-i?ra-u:       ?al-?awlad-u   ?al-dars-a (VSO + FULL)
* ?al-?awlad-u  y-i?ra:      ?al-dars-a (SVO + PARTIAL)

"The children read the lesson"

Imperative + Demonstrative:-----------

 i?ra ?al-kita:b-a da:
 "read this book!"

================== TRANSLATION RESULTS =========================

I only got a few examples working, but I'll try to show what I got!

"The woman hit the food" (whatever that means)
t-adribu ?al-mara-u ?al-taam-a

yields:

hitta-ar kona mat
hitta-ar kona mat-inn
hitta-ar kona-in mat
hitta-ar kona-in mat-inn
kona hitta-ar mat
kona hitta-ar mat-innmadur hyggja-ar ad kona kaupa-ar mat
kona-in hitta-ar mat
kona-in hitta-ar mat-inn

But, as I've noted in ePost, though 'food' and 'cat' have exactly the same distribution in icelandic, I wasn't able to get "The woman hit the cat" to parse (I get an invalid pred error; though I even cut and pasted the pred from Katie's lexicon into my entry for cat).

Also, I haven't been able to find a reason why this isn't working, but I get 0 MRSes for trying to get "The woman hit the small food"

(t-adribu ?al-mara-u ?al-taam-a ?al-sagheer-a)

I've looked at both MRSes, they are at the very bottom.



------------ "The woman gave <X> food"

First, I tried my incorporated pronoun:

t-atay-ni: ?al-mara-u ?al-taam-a

(Where "_give_v_rel" has the following:

ARG0: e2
ARG1: x5 [...PNG.PER: THIRD ... PNG.NUM: sg] (x5 is mapped to woman through a qeq)
ARG2: x3 [...PNG.PER: FIRST ... PNG.NUM: sg] (x3 does not appear elsewhere... I think that's right)
ARG3: x4 [...PNG.PER: THIRD ... PNG.NUM: sg] (x4 is mapped to food through a qeq)

...this got translated to Katie's system as

kona gefa-ar mat-i
kona gefa-ar mat-i-num
kona-in gefa-ar mat-i
kona-in gefa-ar mat-i-num

...which she unfortunately tells me is simply "The woman gives food"

I tried an explicit direct object instead: ("The woman gives the man food")

t-atay ?al-mara-u ?al-rajul-a ?al-taam-a

..which yielded:

kona gefa-ar mann mat-i
kona gefa-ar mann mat-i-num
kona-in gefa-ar mann mat-i
kona-in gefa-ar mann mat-i-num

..which katie said were correct translations, yay!

------- IMPERATIVES

adribu rajul-a-n ("hit a man!")

-->

hitta mann
hitta-id mann
hitta-um mann

..which katie again says are correct.

----------- DEMONSTRATIVES

I tried doing: adribu ?al-rajul-a da: ("hit that man!")

But got the error on katie's side: "invalid predicates: |predsort|"

..I have the pronoun transfer rules as posted in the appropraite places (triple checked), so I'm not sure I know what to do about this.

---------- EMBEDDED CLAUSES:

y-aftikir-na ?anna ?al-mara-u t-ishtara ?al-taam-a
"They (fem) think that the woman buys the food"

and also

y-aftikir ?al-rajul-u...
"The man thinks that..."

...I got zero results, and from what I can tell, it looks like somehow the qeq for the ARG2 to "think" is winding up qeq'ed to a label not in the MRS; I'm not sure what this means.

======= WRAP-UP ========================================

For this lab, not only did I get the deflected agreement working, I also managed to get rid of the bare endings so that even the "y-aftikir ?al-rajul-u ?anna ?al-mara-u t-ishtara ?al-taam-a" above generates in very little time.

As I mentioned in class, I'd mistakenly written much of my test suite without thinking about deflected agreement. I went back and tried to find places where I'd put false positive or negatives, but I may have missed a few. Thankfully it seems I stuck to mostly singular subjects, so although I imagine this isn't the best coverage I can get, it's still better than it has been, and with very little overgeneration!


My coverage is now at 49.2%, up from 42% in lab8.

My overgeneration analysis from tsdb is looking very good at 6.6% down from around 7.9% , though, again, this may be falsely high.
