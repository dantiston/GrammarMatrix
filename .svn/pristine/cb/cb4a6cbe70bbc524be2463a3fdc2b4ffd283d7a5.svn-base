# StringMod class creates objects which modify strings in semantically
# neutral ways.  Call by add_permutes.py.

# It's time to update add_permutes so that it handles the non-semantics changing
# variations.  That is, we will ask the developers to now:

# 1) provide harvester strings
# 2) add instances of StringMod to represent semantically neutral
#    modifications.

# We should still record non-harvester seed strings in the DB so we can look
# them up and see if they have already been done.  That way, when someone comes
# up with a new variation that requires making new seed strings from existing
# harvesters, we can rerun without worrying about creating duplicates.

# The existing semantically-neutral variations are:

# mrs_id_list		variation
# -----------		---------
# all			add p-nom
# trans			add p-acc
# all			add aux
# trans			tv -> tv-nf
# intrans			iv -> iv-nf
# neg			drop neg  (we'll need to add a filter that says we 
# 				should only get neg semantics when we see
# 				some sort of overt negation)
# neg			add neg-
# ques			drop qpart (for inversion ex.)
# ques			add -ques

# The above are all independent.  That is, for any given harvester string,
# we want to try the powerset of all of the applicable variations.

# So: 

# variation a
# 	apply and pass through variation b
# 	don't apply and pass through variation b

# variation b
# 	apply and pass through variation c
# 	don't apply and pass through variation c

# etc.

# Because the seed strings are essentially just bags of words,
# it doesn't matter what order we do things in.  On the other hand,
# when we get to more complex clauses (and, ahem, coordination) we
# might need to count things within the input string.

# g.py defines global variables for classes of mrs tags.
