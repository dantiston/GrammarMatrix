# Variables storing sets of MRSs ids.  We can add to these and update multiple
# filters at once as we add harvester strings.

# These variables are referenced in s_filters, u_filters, and add_permutes and stringmod.py

# NOTE: When adding new mrs_ids to these lists, one should always examine
# the filters that call the lists being modified.  In some cases, we may need
# to create new lists in order to maintain the right behavior.

# _FIX_ME_ This should probably be stored in the DB, and g.py should read
# in definitions of these variables.
