It absolutely makes more sense to have the lexical entries
for nouns not specify and case and then have lexical rules
which derive all the cases from that underlying form (including
nominative).

You are specifying the case of subjects multiple times (and
redundantly).  Your verbal inflection rules do it, and so do
itr-verb-lex, nom-part-tr-verb-lex, and nom-acc-tr-verb-lex.
You should either do it on the lexical rules or on the 
lexeme types.  If the latter, the constraint could probably
be stated just once, on a new supertype called, say, verb-lex.

The lab didn't ask to make sure you can still generate,
but it's always a good idea.  When I try with your first
example, I get the "probable circular lexical rule" error.
I believe we discussed this on EPost.  You should fix it
before you turn in the next lab.

Your subject-verb agreement could have been tested much
more thoroughly in your testsuite.  Also, I couldn't find
the source of your testsuite -- the file that you imported
the items from.  I was hoping to see something there with
glosses of the items (now I know what to put in the directions
for next week/next year :-).

Your pl_noun-lex-rule does not inherit from a specific enough
supertype.  local-change-only leaves most of the LOCAL
value of the mother underspecified.  Or rather, I should say
that given that you're working with such an underspecified supertype,
you need to make sure to copy up all the information that is
not either changed or otherwise being copied up.  You can
simplify this somewhat by having neither sg nor pl be the base
form, and deriving both (then you're only adding information,
and you can use the `add-only' lex rule type).

You'll also need to work out the ordering of your lex rules,
and make the last one be lexeme-to-word.
