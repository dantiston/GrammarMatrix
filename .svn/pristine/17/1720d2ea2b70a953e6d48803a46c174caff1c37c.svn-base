Lab 9 Grading Rubric
  
---------------------------------------------------------------

 Negation was implemented by the LKB based on the
 customization script I filled out. The only changes I made to the
 original lexical type definition was adding the constraint that the
 verb modified must have [FORM fin].

The customization script is not part of the LKB, but rather
a separate piece of software.

 The demonstrative pronoun "zh" is always used in its masculine
 singular form when used to refer to event or state (a previous
 sentence) rather than an individual (NP in a previous sentence).I
 think that "zh" needs two lexical entries, one as the demonstrative
 pronoun "this one" that is listed along with its feminine and plural
 variants and one as the pronoun "it" when used to refer to a previous
 sentence. Only in the latter sense when in the accusative it must it
 be preceded by the accusative marker "at" without the "h" preceding
 it.

Nice observation.

 This looks correct. However, I was getting two parses for this
 sentence, both of them leading to the same semantics. One resulted
 from the adj-head-scop-phrase rule applying before the head-comp rule
 which unifies "eat" with "glass" (i.e. modifying the verb) and the
 other with the adj-head-scop-phrase rule applying after the head-comp
 rule (i.e. modifying the VP). Since I want the negation adverb to
 modify the verb and not the VP, I added the following constraint:

The features LIGHT and HC-LIGHT are for this purpose.  Set HC-LIGHT to
- on verb-lex and then require LIGHT + in the MOD of the negative adverb.
That'll force low attachment.

 This is because in the current grammar the adverb "mhr" can modify
 "read" or "can't read" or "She can't read". Something needs to be done
 about this as in cases such as this, there should only be one
 parse. But how to block the other two parses without blocking other
 possible word orders?

I don't know :(
