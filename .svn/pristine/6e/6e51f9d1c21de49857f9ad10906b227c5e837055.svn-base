Lab 7 Grading Rubric

	I'd like to see two message relations here: question_m_rel
	embedding a proposition_m_rel.

	qeq is broken.

The grammar you turned in wouldn't load, because of this:

msg-cord-rule := coord-phrase &
  [ LCOORD-DTR.SYNSEM.LOCAL.CONT #msg & [MSG message],
    RCOORD-DTR.SYNSEM.LOCAL.CONT #msg]. 

I think what you meant was this:

msg-cord-rule := coord-phrase &
  [ LCOORD-DTR.SYNSEM.LOCAL.CONT.MSG #msg & message,
    RCOORD-DTR.SYNSEM.LOCAL.CONT.MSG #msg]. 

In addition, your head-opt-subj rule had broken semantics.
It needs:

head-opt-subj-phrase := basic-head-opt-subj-phrase &
 [ C-CONT [ RELS <! !>,
	    HCONS <! !> ]].

In addition, the head-opt-subj-phrase should pass up the
HOOK inforamtion from the head daughter.  Making it inherit
from head-compositional will do the trick.  Otherwise, some
of your qeqs get broken.
