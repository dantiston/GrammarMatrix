	When no determiner is present, it is either a proper noun or
 	an indefinite article.

By this I take you mean that if there is no overt marking of definiteness,
and the NP isn't a proper noun, then it gets an indefinite interpretation?

	The articles also have agreement with case, gender, person
	and number. This is true of both free and suffixed articles. The 
	chart below illustrates some of the different suffixed articles:

Really agreement in person? That would imply that there are "articles"
for non-3rd person NPs.

	The dative case is used in indirect objects (also like English),
	but there are verbs that have the direct object as dative. Genitive
	case is mostly used in possesives, but is also used in measurement.

English does not have dative case.  There may be noun phrase positions
that we call dative, but that is only on analogy to other Germanic
languages (including older stages of English.)

There are more morphemes in the 2nd line than grams in
the third.  What is the gloss for -ur-?

I don't see any examlpes illustrating agreement between free
articles and their head nouns.
