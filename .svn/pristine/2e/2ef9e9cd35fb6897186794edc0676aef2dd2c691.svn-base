Comments: the current test suite has sentences in the order they came to me. I will reorganize the sentences for the actual test suite so that all examples of given phenomenon are together.

My six Lab 3 phenomena are: 

1. Negation
2. Matrix Yes-No questions
3. Imperatives
4. Embedded clauses
5. Coordination
6. Relative clauses

I am skipping Adjectives because everything pertaining to the agreement, coordination, and word order of adjectives has been already covered under different headings. There are other issues pertaining to adjectives that I might get to in the future, time permitting. I am skipping Modals for now as a section just because it would be the seventh section. However, there are several examples pertaining to modals in the test suite (#107, #108, #109, #110). 

Comment regarding agreement: Hebrew has two genders: masculine and feminine, 3 persons: 1st, 2nd, and 3rd, and two number values: singular and plural. When a plural refers to both masculine and feminine entities, the masculine forms are used.

Comment regarding morpheme boundaries and glosses: between Lab 2 and Lab 3 I made some changes in my labeling strategy both with to the morpheme boundaries and with respect to the glosses.

Morpheme boundaries and glossing of  Verbs:
1. Verb forms for which at least some of the person-number-gender inflection is apparent in the undotted form have that information in the morpheme line separated by a hyphen:

alk
a-hlk:PAAL.FUT
1SG-go:PAAL.FUT
"I will go"

In this case, the prefix "a" represents the 1SG future morpheme. Note that I am not marking the "a" for FUT again, even though the morpheme for 1SG in other tenses is different. I hope that is OK.

2. Verb forms for which the person-number-gender inflection is not apparent in the undotted form have no information in the morpheme line. In the gloss line that inflection information is separated with a period:

rc
rwc:PAAL.PRES
run:PAAL.PRES.SG.M
"I/you/he runs"

In this case, there is no visible inflection (though the vowels give inflectional information on this form), so the number and gender information is presented following the period. The 3SG.M in the PAST and the SG.M are usually the unmarked forms.

tlk
t-hlk:PAAL.FUT
2SG-go:PAAL.FUT.M
"You will go"

In this case, the the prefix "t" represents the 2SG future morpheme. The suffix is null, so the information about the gender is presented following the period.
In fact, "t" is the morpheme of the FUT 2nd person whether it is SG or PL and it is also the morpheme of the FUT 3rd person feminine whether it is SG or PL. It is the combination if this prefix with the additional suffix that clarifies which of the forms it is. In fact, in the future tense 2SG.M is identical to 3SG.F. I am not representing these ambiguities in this notation as I don't think there is a neat way of representing it. I hope that is OK.

Morpheme boundaries and glossing of Nouns:
Hebrew has two genders: masculine and feminine. There are some clues in the orthography to indicate which gender the noun is likely to be, but there are enough exceptions to make the breakdown undesirable in the lexicon. Therefore, I am not following the "ragazz-a & ragazz-o" type notation and am treating each noun as having an inherent gender (a la gateau) . Therefore, the gender is presented as internal to the word and separated by a semicolon (I believe that the semicolon represents the idea that there is some inflection but that it is irrelevant to the example).

aeh
aeh
woman:SG.F

Initially, I thought I would represent the PL.M & PL.F information as hypthenated inflection. But that is not a good idea either. While the suffix "wt" is generally the suffix used for PL.F and the suffix "im" is the suffix used for PL.M, this is strictly true only in the case of adjectives. When it comes to nouns there are enough exceptions to make this generalization unprofitable. Therefore, I am treating the gender information as internal to the word even in the case of plural nouns. Each word in the lexicon will have to have information as to its gender and as to the type of plural suffix it combines with.

sprim yl ewlxnwt wksawt.
spr-im yl ewlxn-wt w-ksa-wt
book:M-PL on table:M-PL and-chair:M-PL

In this example, one can see that while all nouns are masculine, the noun "spr" (book) gets the typical suffix "im" when pluralized while "ewlxn" (table) and "ksa" (chair) while also masculine get the suffix "wt", which is more typical of feminine nouns. Therefore, the gender information is attached to the noun via a semicolon. The number information is attached to the noun with a hyphen because the two suffixes, "wt" and "im" do indicate that the noun is plural (there are some exceptions to this as well, but they are rare). 

In the case of adjectives, the "im" and "wt" suffixes are regular in that the former indicate PL.M and the latter PL.F, the entire marking in shown following a hyphen. The SG.M is the unmarked form and this information is therefore incorporated in the word via a semicolon:

myniin
myniin
interesting:SG.M
interesting
 
myniint
myniin-t
interesting-SG.F
interesting

myniinim
myniin-im
interesting-PL.M
interesting

myniinwt
myniin-wt
interesting-PL.F
interesting

1. NEGATION

There are several ways to express negation. I will mention 4 of them.
The word, transliterated as "la", and transcribed as "lo", is the basic equivalent of the English "not", as in "He will not go." as well as the English "no" as in "Are you going? No!". It is also used for non-sentential ngeation. As a sentential negator the word "la" modifies the verb. It must immediately precede a tensed verb (#1), whether it is the main verb (#1) or an auxliary (#107), whichever appears first (#107, #108, #109, #110). The word "la" may not modify an imperative verb form (#5). I don't know if it is an adverb selected for by tensed verbs or a modifier of V; I am still not clear on the distinction. For the time being, I refer to this negator in the gloss as neg1.

The second negator, "al" appears in imperative constractions. I refer to it in the gloss as neg2. The verb form that it must immediately precede has to be in the future tense. The result is the negative counterpart of the imperative "tense".

The third negator, glossed as ain:PRES is derived from "ain". The word "ain" is best translated into "there isn't" or "there aren't" and is the negative equivalent of "ie" which best translates into "there is" or "there are". In the examples below, however, this negator functions as the auxiliary verb "don't" and conjugates by person, number and gender. It must immediately precede verb. This form is rarely used in speech.

The fourth negator, glossed as ainn:PRES is another variant of ain:PRES. Like ain:PRES it is derived from "ain". It can function like ain:PRES, that is, it can function as an auxiliary verb in the same contexts as ain:PRES. When not followed by any complements it functions as a negator of somebody's presence. ain:PRES can function this way only if followed by an NP indicating some location. ainn:PRES also exists only in the present tense and only in the first and third persons. The word order in these constructions is more rigid than in other SV constructions discussed so far. See #111, #112.

matrix YES-NO QUESTIONS

Yes-No questions in Hebrew are formed by changing to a rising intonation the equivalent indicative sentences. There is an optional sentence initial particle, "haim", meaning literally, "the-if". Using this particle is not common in colloquial speech. It is somewhat formal.

IMPARATIVES

The imperative "tense"appearing in the following forms only: 2SG.M, 2SG.F, 2PL.M, 2PL.F. I am refering to it as a "tense" because this is the way it was labeled when I studied Hebrew grammar in high-school. 
The 1PL imperative needs to be expressed differently (like the English:  "let's").
In collouqial speech many of these forms are rarely used. The equivalent future forms are used instead. See #37

COORDINATION

Coordination is boring (i.e. no different from English) except in cases involving agreement of conjoined adjectives in an NP or NPs in a PP. The difference is in the way the two languages handle definiteness. For example, in English, the determiner "the" is the specifier of the noun and it is combined with the noun.  So in the sentence "I saw the pretty and pleasant girl", we coordinate "pretty and pleasant" which in turn modifies "girl", and that Nom, "pretty and plesant girl" combines with its specifier, "the" to form the NP, "the pretty and pleasant girl"  is an NP. The sentence "I saw the pretty and the pleasant girl" is odd, but if it is at all possible I guess it would be a case of the coordination of the gappy "the pretty" with "the pleasant girl". The reason that "the pretty and pleasant girl" cannot be a case of the coordination of "the pretty" and "pleasant girl" or "the pretty girl" and "pleasant girl" is that "pleasant girl" requires a determiner too. In Hebrew the situation is different. Since definiteness is overtly marked on the nouns and all the adjectives that modify them, we can only say: "the pretty and the pleasant girl" and cannot possibly say "the pretty and pleasant girl" because then the second adjective doesn't agree with the noun in terms of definiteness. So the semantics of the English and the Hebrew structure is the same, but the syntax is different.  See below.

RELATIVE CLAUSES

Hebrew has a special relative word "e" (pronounced, "sh") that marks a clause a relative (that same "e" is also the  complementizer in embedded clauses) . When the relative is a direct object the relative clause contains an accusative resumptive pronoun (#67) but only optionally (#73). The relative "e" must attach to the first element of the relative clause (#67, #68, #69). When the relative is a subject the resumptive pronoun is obligatorily absent (#74, #75), unless the sentence has no verb in which case a nomintive personal pronoun must be present to function as a verb (#76, #77). The "e" must attach to some word and may not stand independently (#78). When the relative is in a PP, the resumptive pronoun is obligatory (#93, #94) as the preposition cannot be left dangling.  When the relative is a possessor as in "the man whose book" (#84), there is an obligatory resumptive pronoun, but that is not surprising, as unlike the English "whose" the relative marker "e" carries insufficient information. The one interesting construction involving a relative is #92. Unlike in English it is possible in Hebrew to relativize an NP that is a corrdinated structure, and say "The man, that he and his mother are doctors...". See below.

#67 - contrast with #68, #69, #70, #71, #72, #73, #93, #94  - Object relatives take a resumptive pronoun optionally.
