The grammar you turn in prints four warnings in the LKB top
window about lexical entries being redefined.  Please look
into this.

From irules.tdl:
 m-cl1to3-acc-noun := m-clto3-sg-acc-lex-rule.

Lexical rules which do not add overt affixes belong in
lrules.tdl.


	Icelandic has a complex noun declension system. There are different
 inflections for each case and number for each gender. There are four
 classes with different inflection in each gender as well as a strong
 and a weak declension. This could be represented as an ALTS feature.
 However, for the sake of clarity, I have chosen to break down noun
 types instead. I figured that this would be easier to debug and 
 understand conceptually.

This sounds reasonable to me.  If you were to use ALTS, you'd end up
making the subtypes anyway, so that you didn't need to keep repeating
the ALTS information.  The alternative is to have it taken care of
by the morphophonological analyzer.
